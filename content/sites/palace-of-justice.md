## History and Significance

The Palace of Justice has a storied past that intersects with some of the most significant events of the 20th century. Originally constructed as a courthouse, it gained international prominence during the Nuremberg Trials, which commenced in 1945.

The trials were conducted in the very courtroom that still exists within the Palace of Justice, known as Courtroom 600. This courtroom became the stage for dramatic legal battles, where evidence of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime was presented. The significance of these trials went beyond the immediate prosecution of war criminals; they laid the groundwork for future international tribunals and contributed to the development of legal standards regarding human rights.
