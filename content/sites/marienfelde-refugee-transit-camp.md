## History and Significance

Established during a time of significant upheaval, the Marienfelde refugee transit camp played a crucial role in the migration landscape of post-World War II Europe. Following the division of Germany in 1949, it became a primary point of entry for East German refugees seeking asylum in the West. The camp operated as a processing center where individuals and families could receive temporary shelter, medical care, and assistance as they transitioned into their new lives.

The significance of Marienfelde extends beyond its physical structures; it represents a broader narrative of human rights and the ongoing struggles faced by refugees. The camp witnessed the stories of many who escaped oppressive regimes, highlighting the urgent need for safety and stability.
