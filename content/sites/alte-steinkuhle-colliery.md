## History and Significance

The Alte Steinkuhle Colliery is emblematic of the broader industrial movement that transformed Germany during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mining in the Ruhr area began to flourish as coal became a vital energy source, fueling both industry and households. The colliery played an integral role in this development, contributing to the economic rise of Bochum and the surrounding regions.

During its operational years, the Alte Steinkuhle Colliery not only provided employment to thousands of miners but also served as a community hub. The life of miners was often grueling, marked by long hours and hazardous working conditions. The colliery's existence reflects the struggles and triumphs of these workers, making it a significant site for understanding the social history of the area.

As the demand for coal began to decline in the late 20th century, many collieries, including Alte Steinkuhle, faced closure. However, instead of being forgotten, this site has been preserved to honor the legacy of the mining community and educate future generations.
