The Brücke Museum was established to honor the legacy of Die Brücke, an influential group of artists founded in 1905 in Dresden, Germany.

Their works often depicted urban life, human figures, and landscapes infused with expressive color and dynamic forms.

In addition to its permanent collection, the Brücke Museum frequently hosts temporary exhibitions that explore various facets of Expressionism and its impact on contemporary art.
