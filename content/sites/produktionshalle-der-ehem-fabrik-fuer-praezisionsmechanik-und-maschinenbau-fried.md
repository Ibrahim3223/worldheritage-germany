This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the former factory, its historical context, architectural features, and practical information for those wishing to visit.

## History and Significance

The Produktionshalle der ehem. Fabrik für Präzisionsmechanik und Maschinenbau Friedrich Deckel stands as a symbol of the post-war industrial boom in Germany. The 1950s marked a period of reconstruction and innovation, and the establishment of this factory was part of a broader movement to modernize manufacturing processes and adopt advanced engineering techniques. The factory specialized in precision mechanics and machine construction, fields that were crucial for Germany's economic recovery and growth following World War II.

Under the vision of Walter Henn, the factory's design reflects the ethos of its time—functionality was paramount, and the architectural style leaned towards simplicity and efficiency. This approach not only facilitated the production processes within the factory but also allowed for a more fluid interaction between workers and machinery, enhancing productivity.

The factory’s significance extends beyond its operational capabilities. It represents a shift in industrial architecture, where form began to follow function in a way that harmonized the work environment with the needs of its users. The building's expansive upper floor—free from columns—was particularly innovative, allowing for flexibility in the arrangement of machinery and workspace, which is crucial in a factory setting.

As manufacturing technologies evolved, so did the factory's capabilities. The legacy of the Friedrich Deckel factory continues to resonate within the broader context of industrial design and engineering. Today, it not only serves as a reminder of Munich's rich industrial past but also as a venue for events and exhibitions that focus on innovation and technology.

## Architecture and Features

The architectural design of the Produktionshalle der ehem. Fabrik für Präzisionsmechanik und Maschinenbau Friedrich Deckel is notable for its utilitarian yet aesthetically pleasing form. Constructed as a two-story flat-roofed building, the factory exemplifies the modernist principles that were gaining traction in the post-war era. The use of a flat roof not only enhances the building's silhouette but also maximizes the interior space—an essential feature for industrial operations.

The factory measures an impressive 72 by 82 meters, reflecting the scale of operations that were envisioned during its inception. The ground floor is dedicated to material storage and workshops, providing essential support to the factory's production activities. Above, the column-free upper floor is a hallmark of its design, allowing for an expansive, open space that can be adapted to various needs, from manufacturing to exhibition.

The materials used in the construction embody the industrial aesthetic, characterized by functional elements that prioritize efficiency over ornamentation. Large windows allow natural light to flood the workspace, creating a more pleasant environment for workers and enhancing visibility for precise tasks. This interplay of light and space is a testament to Henn's forward-thinking approach, recognizing the importance of a conducive work environment.

In addition to its structural features, the factory's design reflects the technological advancements of the time. The integration of modern machinery and production methods was a key focus, ensuring that the factory could keep pace with the evolving needs of precision engineering.
