## History and Significance

The Stiftung Berliner Mauer emerged from the need to remember and educate about the Berlin Wall, which stood from 1961 until 1989. Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Wall was originally erected to prevent East Germans from fleeing to West Germany. Its existence encapsulated the ideological divide between the communist East and the capitalist West, becoming a powerful symbol of oppression and division.

Following the Wall's fall in November 1989, the historical importance of this structure was recognized globally, prompting initiatives to preserve remnants of the Wall and educate future generations. The foundation plays a crucial role in this mission. Its establishment not only aims to commemorate those who lost their lives attempting to cross the Wall but also serves as a platform for dialogue about the consequences of division and the importance of freedom.

The foundation has been instrumental in facilitating research, developing educational programs, and organizing public events that encourage reflection on the lessons learned from this period. As such, it functions not only as a memorial but also as a hub for contemporary discussions around freedom, human rights, and the importance of remembrance in our societies.

The site includes original guard towers, sections of the concrete barrier, and the preserved "death strip," which was a no-man's land patrolled by guards.
