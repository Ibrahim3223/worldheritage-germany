## History and Significance

The Blumenbachsche Schädelsammlung is an important part of the academic heritage of the Georg-August-Universität, which has played a pivotal role in the development of modern anthropology. The collection is named after Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a prominent figure in the field of physical anthropology during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Blumenbach's work laid the foundational principles for the study of human variation and classification, making his contributions vital to the understanding of human biology and diversity.

While specific dates regarding the establishment of the collection are not detailed, its significance is rooted in the historical context of anthropological science in Europe.
