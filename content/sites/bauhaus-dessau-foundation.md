## History and Significance

The Bauhaus movement originated in Germany in the early 20th century, fundamentally altering the approach to art and design. Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus school sought to bridge the gap between fine arts and applied arts, emphasizing the importance of craftsmanship alongside innovative design. The Dessau location became a pivotal center for the movement in the 1920s, as it housed the school from 1925 until its closure in 1932. During this time, Bauhaus attracted numerous influential artists and designers, including Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and Marcel Breuer, who contributed to its reputation as a breeding ground for modernist thought.

The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation was established to preserve and promote this important cultural heritage. It encompasses not only the museum aspect but also a dedicated space for research and education related to the Bauhaus legacy. The foundation undertakes various initiatives, including exhibitions that showcase both historical and contemporary works influenced by Bauhaus principles, workshops, and lectures that encourage dialogue about the relevance of these ideas today.
