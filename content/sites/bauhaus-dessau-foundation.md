## History and Significance

The Bauhaus movement, founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, emerged as an avant-garde school of art and design that sought to unify art, craft, and technology. Over the decades, it transformed the landscape of modern design and architecture. The Dessau site became a key location for the Bauhaus, particularly during its tenure from 1925 to 1932, when the school relocated there from Weimar. This period marked the establishment of the iconic Bauhaus building designed by Gropius, which itself is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The foundation plays a critical role in preserving this legacy, housing extensive collections that document the development of Bauhaus design principles and their implications for contemporary art. It not only showcases works from notable figures associated with the movement but also contextualizes the broader cultural and historical shifts that influenced its evolution.
