## History and Significance

The history of KZ Neuengamme is intertwined with the broader context of the Nazi regime's oppressive machinery. Established in the early 1930s, the camp was initially utilized for the imprisonment of political dissidents and later expanded to include a diverse range of victims, including Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi ideology. Throughout its operation, Neuengamme became a site of forced labor, where countless individuals endured inhumane conditions while contributing to the war effort through grueling work.

The significance of the site extends beyond its operational years. After the war, it served as a location for the denazification process and later became a memorial site, dedicated to preserving the memory of the victims and educating future generations about the horrors of totalitarian regimes.
