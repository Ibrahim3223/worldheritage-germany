## History and Significance

The Marx-Engels Forum is a prominent site that encapsulates the ideological battles and cultural shifts that have defined Berlin and, by extension, Europe. Its establishment reflects the city's long-standing engagement with socialist thought and the historical context within which Marx and Engels developed their ideas. These two philosophers, who laid the groundwork for modern socialism and communism, are remembered not only for their revolutionary theories but also for their profound influence on political movements worldwide.

The memorial park serves as a reminder of the tumultuous history of the 19th and 20th centuries, marked by revolutions, wars, and the struggles for workers' rights.
