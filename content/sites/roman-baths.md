The Roman Baths are emblematic of the neoclassical revival that swept through Europe in the 18th century, particularly in Germany.

The design of the baths reflects the king's fascination with classical antiquity, showcasing his desire to blend nature with cultural and architectural artistry.

The significance of the Roman Baths extends beyond mere aesthetics. They symbolize the Enlightenment ideals of beauty, reason, and harmony, mirroring the philosophical movements of the time.
