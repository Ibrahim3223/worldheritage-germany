## History and Significance

Buchenwald was established in 1937 near Weimar, Germany, and became one of the largest concentration camps in the country. Initially intended for political prisoners, the camp expanded to include a diverse group of inmates, including Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime. The harsh conditions, forced labor, and systematic extermination contributed to the suffering of thousands. The camp was liberated by American forces in 1945, revealing the extent of the atrocities that took place within its walls.

Mittelbau-Dora, a subcamp of Buchenwald, was created to exploit the labor of prisoners for the production of V-2 rockets during World War II. The camp was characterized by its brutal working conditions, leading to high mortality rates among inmates. The significance of these camps extends beyond their physical structures; they symbolize the broader history of genocide and human rights violations.

The memorials are crucial for preserving the memory of the victims and fostering an environment of learning and dialogue. They serve as a reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance, urging visitors to confront the past to build a more just and equitable future. The foundation plays an essential role in promoting educational programs, research, and remembrance initiatives that honor those who suffered.
