Its purpose was to serve as a formidable defensive barrier against potential incursions from France, reflecting the geopolitical tensions of the time.

The museum itself plays a vital role in preserving the memory of this period. It offers insights into the strategies employed during World War II, showcasing how the Siegfried Line was fortified and utilized during various military campaigns.
