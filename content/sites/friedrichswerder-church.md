The church was completed during a time of significant change in Berlin, as the city was evolving into a cultural capital of Europe. It served not only as a place for worship but also as a symbol of national identity and unity. Over the years, the church has witnessed historical events, including the rise and fall of empires, making it a silent observer of the shifting tides of history.

Despite facing challenges, including damage during World War II, Friedrichswerder Church underwent restoration efforts that allowed it to retain its architectural essence.
