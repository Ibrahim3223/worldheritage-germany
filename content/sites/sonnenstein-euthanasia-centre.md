As a site of remembrance and education, the Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre promises an experience that challenges visitors to confront uncomfortable truths about humanity. This guide aims to equip you with essential information for a visit that is both informative and reflective.

## History and Significance

The Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre was part of the broader T4 program initiated by the Nazi regime, which aimed at the systematic extermination of individuals considered to be physically or mentally unfit. While the programme was officially discontinued in 1941 due to public outcry and resistance, the impact of the actions carried out at Sonnenstein and other facilities remains a critical area of study in understanding the extent of human rights abuses during the Holocaust.

The centre operated under the guise of medical treatment but was, in reality, a killing facility where thousands of individuals were murdered. This history is not just confined to the events that occurred within the walls of the castle; it reflects a societal mindset that rationalized such atrocities through a perverse interpretation of eugenics and public health. The cultural importance of the Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre lies in its role as a site of remembrance, education, and reflection on the consequences of dehumanization.

Furthermore, the museum serves as a powerful educational resource, facilitating discussions on ethics, morality, and the responsibilities of society towards its most vulnerable members. By preserving the memory of those who suffered, the centre aims to foster a commitment to ensuring that such actions are never repeated, reminding visitors of the fragility of human rights.
