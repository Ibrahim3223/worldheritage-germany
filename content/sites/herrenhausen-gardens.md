The history of Herrenhausen Gardens is deeply intertwined with the identity of Hanover itself. Originally established as a private garden for the royal family, the gardens reflect the ambitions of the House of Hanover, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries when they were extensively developed. Under the reign of Elector Ernest Augustus and later his son, George I of Great Britain, the gardens evolved from simple pleasure grounds into grandiose landscapes that showcased the latest horticultural trends and artistry.

Its layout features symmetrical pathways, ornate fountains, and carefully manicured hedges, all designed to impress visitors and reflect the power and prestige of the Hanoverian rulers. The gardens not only served as a recreational space for the royal family but also as a demonstration of their wealth and taste, influencing garden design throughout Europe.

As the years progressed, the gardens faced various challenges, including wartime destruction and post-war reconstruction. Restoration efforts have preserved the essential features of the gardens while also allowing for modern additions that enhance their appeal.
