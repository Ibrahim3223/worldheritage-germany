## History and Significance

The history of mine Consolidation is deeply intertwined with the industrialization of Gelsenkirchen and the surrounding areas. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal mining became the backbone of the local economy, with multiple mines operating in the region, each contributing to the expansion of industries and urban development.
