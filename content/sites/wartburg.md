## History and Significance

Wartburg's history is intertwined with significant events and figures in German culture. The castle was founded in the 11th century and has since played a crucial role in the sociopolitical landscape of the region. One of its most prominent associations is with Martin Luther, who sought refuge here in 1521 after being declared an outlaw by the Holy Roman Empire. It was during this time that he translated the New Testament into German, making the scriptures accessible to a broader audience and significantly influencing the Protestant Reformation. This act not only transformed religious practices but also impacted the German language and literature.

The castle itself has witnessed various transformations, reflecting the changing tastes and needs of its occupants. Throughout the centuries, it has served as a residence for counts, a cultural hub for artists, and a symbol of German national identity. Notably, the Wartburg Festival in 1817, which celebrated the ideals of freedom and unity, further solidified its significance as a national symbol. It became a gathering place for students advocating for liberal reforms, reinforcing its role in the history of German nationalism.
