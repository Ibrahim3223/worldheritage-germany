The establishment of the museum reflects a collective memory that acknowledges the struggles faced by refugees. It serves as an archive organization that preserves documents, personal accounts, and artifacts that narrate the experiences of those who passed through the center. These stories, often marked by hardship and resilience, contribute to a broader understanding of migration issues that persist today. The museum not only honors the past but also encourages dialogue about current refugee crises, emphasizing the need for compassion and empathy in addressing these challenges.

Through various exhibitions, visitors gain insight into the historical context of refugee movements, the policies surrounding asylum, and the societal responses to these phenomena. The museum acts as a platform for education and awareness, fostering discussions that are vital in a world increasingly affected by migration.
