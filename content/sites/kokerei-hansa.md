## History and Significance

The history of Kokerei Hansa is intertwined with the rise of the coal and steel industries in Germany, particularly in the Ruhr region. This industrial area, once the powerhouse of the German economy, saw a rapid expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, driven by the demand for coal and iron. Kokerei Hansa was established to support this burgeoning industry, operating primarily as a coking plant that converted coal into coke, a vital component for steel manufacturing.

The factory's establishment contributed to job creation and economic growth in the region, shaping the lives of countless workers and their families.
