## History and Significance

Neuer Zollhof's significance is deeply rooted in its role within the broader context of Düsseldorf's urban transformation. The area where it is located was once a bustling port, integral to the trade and commerce that fueled the city's growth. Over time, as shipping practices evolved and industrial activity shifted, the Media Harbour district fell into decline. However, in recent decades, a concerted effort has been made to revitalize the area, leading to the creation of a dynamic space that celebrates both its historical roots and contemporary innovation.

The museum's commitment to education and cultural dissemination ensures that the stories of the past are not only remembered but actively engaged with by future generations.
