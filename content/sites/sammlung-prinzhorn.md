## History and Significance

The Sammlung Prinzhorn was established with a vision to collect and display artworks created by individuals who have experienced mental health challenges.

The collection originated from the work of Hans Prinzhorn, a German psychiatrist and art historian whose groundbreaking studies in the early 20th century highlighted the artistic capabilities of patients in psychiatric care.

Prinzhorn’s research demonstrated that art could serve as a powerful medium for self-expression, offering insights into the inner lives of those often marginalized by society. The artworks in the collection reflect a range of styles and mediums, showcasing the diverse emotional and psychological landscapes of their creators. By bringing these works into the public eye, Sammlung Prinzhorn not only honors the artists themselves but also invites contemplation on broader themes of mental health, creativity, and the human condition.
