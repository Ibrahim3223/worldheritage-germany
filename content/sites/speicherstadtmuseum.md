## History and Significance

The Speicherstadt district was established during the late 19th century, primarily as a free trade zone to accommodate the growing demands of international trade. The idea was to create a space where goods could be stored and handled without the immediate imposition of customs duties, thus facilitating commerce. The unique architectural style of the warehouses—characterized by red-brick facades, gabled roofs, and intricate detailing—reflects the industrial heritage of the time and has become emblematic of Hamburg’s identity.
