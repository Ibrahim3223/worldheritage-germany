Its significance lies not only in its extensive collection but also in its architectural innovation and cultural narrative.

Over the years, the museum has undergone various transformations and restorations, particularly following damage sustained during World War II. The extensive reconstruction, which began in the early 2000s and was led by British architect David Chipperfield, aimed to preserve the original design while incorporating modern elements. This careful approach to restoration has allowed the museum to continue serving as a crucial venue for cultural exchange and education.
