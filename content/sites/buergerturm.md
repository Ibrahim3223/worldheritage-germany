## History and Significance

The Bürgerturm's origins date back to the mid-14th century when it was constructed as part of the medieval fortifications that protected the town of Freising. The tower's primary role was to serve as a watchtower, a crucial component in the defense strategy against potential invasions. During this period, Freising was a significant settlement, and the construction of such fortifications was essential for maintaining security and order within the town.

Throughout the centuries, the Bürgerturm has undergone various transformations. By the 16th century, it had shifted from a defensive structure to a residential one, indicating changes in societal needs and priorities. The tower's subsequent use as a prison and a poorhouse reflects the evolving socio-economic landscape of Freising, where such institutions were necessary to address the challenges of poverty and crime.

One of the most notable architectural developments occurred in 1711 when the Bürgerturm received its distinctive tent roof, marking a significant alteration to its original design. This change not only enhanced the tower's visual appeal but also indicated the ongoing importance of the structure within the town's architectural narrative.
