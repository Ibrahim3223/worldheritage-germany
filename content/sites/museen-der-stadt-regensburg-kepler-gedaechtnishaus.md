## History and Significance

Johannes Kepler, born in 1571, was a key figure in the scientific revolution and is best known for his laws of planetary motion, which laid the groundwork for modern astronomy. The Kepler-Gedächtnishaus is dedicated to preserving his memory and contributions to science.

The museum aims to communicate this broader significance, illustrating how Kepler's theories influenced not only future scientists but also the way humanity perceives its place in the universe.

In addition to Kepler's scientific contributions, the museum offers insights into the time he lived in, a period marked by intense intellectual exploration and conflict.
