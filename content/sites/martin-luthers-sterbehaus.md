## History and Significance

Martin Luther, born in 1483, is best known for his role in initiating the Protestant Reformation.

The house where Luther died, now Martin Luthers Sterbehaus, is not just a place of historical interest but a site of immense cultural significance. Luther passed away in 1546, and the house became a sanctuary for his followers and a pilgrimage site for those influenced by his teachings.

It invites visitors to reflect on the ongoing relevance of Luther's ideas in contemporary discussions about faith, governance, and individual rights.
