## History and Significance

The Neuengamme concentration camp was established in 1938, primarily for the forced labor of prisoners. Over the years, it became a site of immense suffering, where detainees faced brutal conditions, forced labor, and systematic extermination. The camp's location in Hamburg, a significant industrial hub, contributed to the exploitation of its prisoners, who were used to support the war effort. 

One of the most harrowing aspects of the camp's legacy is the fate of the children who were forcibly brought to the Bullenhuser Damm area. In 1945, as the war drew to a close, a group of approximately 20 children, most of whom were Jewish, were taken from the camp and subjected to horrific medical experiments. The chilling conclusion to their lives came shortly after, as they were murdered to eliminate any witnesses to the atrocities. This dark chapter highlights the depths of cruelty that occurred during this period and underscores the importance of confronting this history.

The memorial now serves as a vital educational resource, promoting awareness of the Holocaust and fostering dialogue about the ongoing implications of hate and discrimination. It aims to instill a sense of responsibility in future generations, emphasizing the need for vigilance against intolerance and the importance of human rights.

The site’s establishment as a memorial reflects a broader movement within Germany and worldwide to ensure that the memories of victims are preserved, and lessons are learned from the past. It is an essential place for reflection, remembrance, and education, inviting visitors to engage with the history while fostering a commitment to a more just and humane future.
