## History and Significance

Neuschwanstein Castle is a remarkable example of 19th-century romantic architecture, reflecting the ideals and aspirations of its creator, Ludwig II of Bavaria.

Constructed under the guidance of architect Georg von Dollmann, Neuschwanstein’s design draws heavily from the Romanesque Revival style, which sought to revive the grandeur of medieval architecture.
