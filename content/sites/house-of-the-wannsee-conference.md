## History and Significance

The House of the Wannsee Conference was originally built as a private villa in the early 20th century and later became the site of a pivotal meeting on January 20, 1942.

The meeting culminated in the discussion of the logistics and processes required to carry out what would be referred to as the "Final Solution." 

The significance of the Wannsee Conference extends beyond the meeting itself; it symbolizes the bureaucratic machinery that enabled one of the greatest atrocities in human history. The decisions made in this villa laid the groundwork for the Holocaust, resulting in the deaths of millions.
