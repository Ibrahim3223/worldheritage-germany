### II. Understanding UNESCO World Heritage (500 words)

#### What Makes a UNESCO Site?

**The Selection Criteria:**
UNESCO evaluates sites against 10 criteria. Sites must meet at least one criterion and demonstrate "Outstanding Universal Value."

**The 10 Criteria (summarized):**
1. Masterpiece of human creative genius
2. Important interchange of values
3. Unique testimony to cultural tradition
4. Outstanding example of architectural type
5. Traditional human settlement
6. Associated with events or ideas
7. Exceptional natural phenomena (natural sites)
8. Major stages of earth's history (natural sites)
9. Ecological and biological processes (natural sites)
10. Biological diversity and threatened species (natural sites)

**Germany's Success:**
With 52 sites, Germany ranks third globally after Italy (58) and China (56). Most German sites qualify under cultural criteria (1-6), with only two natural sites.

**Why It Matters to Travelers:**
UNESCO status isn't just a badge—it means the site has been rigorously evaluated by international experts, deemed irreplaceable, and is protected for future generations.
